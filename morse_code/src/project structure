-- Create dictionary
-- Reading word from screen
-- Find combination of letters that can form that word:
        -- try every single letter from alphabet start with a and get to z and as soon as first letter is found move to the next one and carry on ( for loop so it can go though all the letters of the alphabet)
        This could be implemented with recursive find letter function
-- Print all solutions
